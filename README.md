## Important Note about Plugin Docs

Plugin docs are automatically synced every night via cron job with various plugin workspace repos, for example:

- https://github.com/NativeScript/firebase
- https://github.com/NativeScript/plugins
- https://github.com/NativeScript/payments

Each plugin workspace can manage it's own set of README's for documentation. This docs repo will keep itself in sync with them every night.
If you want to modify any plugin documentation, you can do so via their plugin workspaces as listed above.

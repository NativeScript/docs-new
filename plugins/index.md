## @nativescript/\* plugins

Many plugins offered by NativeScript's Technical Steering Committee (TSC) are listed in the sidebar/sub navigation to help with your developments. For example, everything from [biometrics](https://docs.nativescript.org/plugins/biometrics.html), [camera](https://docs.nativescript.org/plugins/camera.html) handling, [contacts](https://docs.nativescript.org/plugins/contacts.html) management, [Firebase](https://docs.nativescript.org/plugins/firebase-core.html) integration, [Google Maps](https://docs.nativescript.org/plugins/google-maps.html), to payment management using [Apple Pay](https://docs.nativescript.org/plugins/apple-pay.html), [Google Pay](https://docs.nativescript.org/plugins/google-pay.html), or [IAP and Subscription handling](https://docs.nativescript.org/plugins/payments.html) and many more can be found here.

## Developing your own plugins

If you are interested in building your own plugins, we recommend following our [Getting Started with Plugin Workspaces](https://docs.nativescript.org/plugins/plugin-workspace-guide.html) guide which uses our [plugin workspace seed](https://github.com/NativeScript/plugin-seed) (_the exact same setup the TSC uses to develop it's own plugins_) as a starting point because it provides the following:

- consistent plugin source structure
- ability to scale and add additional plugins through automated tooling
- reduces configuration files to provide easy maintainence
- provides shareable structure for ease of demoing your plugins
- ability to focus your workspace down to a single plugin in an instant if you ever need to isolate development when working within a multi-plugin workspace
- provides automated migrations managed by the TSC to keep your plugin workspaces up-to-date without manual hassles

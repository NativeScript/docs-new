## Getting Started with NativeScript Angular

This tutorial introduces you to the essentials of Angular by walking you through building an Example App with a Some Basic Functionalities and UIs.

This tutorial will teach you the following:

- Build layouts using NativeScript components
- Add interactivity to your app using gestures
- Use built-in Angular directives to create and modify your views
- Use data binding to read and update your views
- Use routing to navigate between different views
- Use Angular animations to add animations to your views

## Prerequisites

To get the most out of this tutorial you should already have a basic understanding of the Angular framework. If you're completely new to Angular, you might want to try the official [Angular tutorial](https://angular.io/tutorial) first.

## Overview of the example application

Components form the basic building blocks of an Angular application. Components represent the pages and views that the user interacts with. NativeScript Angular follows the same concept with the difference being primarily within the component's HTML template layer and it's styling.

You'll build a video streaming app that offers the ability to select and watch videos in the app and bring that experience outside the application in picture-in-picture mode.

![Example app preview](./public/assets/images/tutorial/tutorial-example-app-preview.png)

You can find the complete source code of the application on [Github]()

## Set up your environment

To set up your development environment, follow the instructions in the [Environment Setup](https://docs.nativescript.org/environment-setup.html#windows-android) section of the docs.

## Create a new NativeScript Angular application

To create a new NativeScript Angular application, run the CLI command `ns create` with the name of the application followed by the `--ng`.

```bash
ns create example-app --ng
```

The NativeScript CLI creates a new directory with the root folder named `example-app` with an initial skeleton app project and installs the necessary packages and dependencies. This can take a few minutes and should be ready to run once it's done installing.

## Run the application

Go to the project's directory and run the following command to run it on the respective platforms.

```bash
cd example-app

// run on iOS
ns run ios

// run on Android
ns run android
```

The `ns run` command builds the app and launches the app on a connected Android device or Android emulator for Android and a connected iOS device or iOS simulator for iOS. By default listens for changes in your code, synchronizes those changes, and refresh all selected devices.

## Folder structure

Based on the Angular starter app, we will be creating the following file/folder structure for our application.

```
src/app
  |- core
    |- models
      |- flick.model.ts
    |- services
      |- flick.service.ts
  |- features
    |- home
      |- home.component.ts | html
      |- home.module.ts
      |- home-routing.module.ts
    |- details
      |- details.component.ts | html
      |- details.module.ts
      |- details-routing.module.ts
  ...
```

## Create the home page

Let's start with creating the files for our home feature with the following contents:

/// flavor home.component.html

```html
<!-- src/app/features/home/home.component.html -->
```

///

/// flavor home.component.ts

```typescript
// src/app/features/home/home.component.ts

import { Component } from '@angular/core'

@Component({
  moduleId: module.id,
  selector: 'ns-home',
  templateUrl: 'home.component.html'
})
export class HomeComponent {}
```

///

/// flavor home-routing.module.ts

```typescript
// src/app/features/home/home-routing.module.ts

import { NgModule } from '@angular/core'
import { Routes } from '@angular/router'
import { NativeScriptRouterModule } from '@nativescript/angular'
import { HomeComponent } from './home.component'

export const routes: Routes = [
  {
    path: '',
    component: HomeComponent
  }
]

@NgModule({
  imports: [NativeScriptRouterModule.forChild(routes)]
})
export class HomeRoutingModule {}
```

///

/// flavor home.module.ts

```typescript
// src/app/features/home/home.module.ts

import { NgModule, NO_ERRORS_SCHEMA } from '@angular/core'
import { NativeScriptCommonModule } from '@nativescript/angular'
import { HomeRoutingModule } from './home-routing.module'
import { HomeComponent } from './home.component'

@NgModule({
  imports: [NativeScriptCommonModule, HomeRoutingModule],
  declarations: [HomeComponent],
  schemas: [NO_ERRORS_SCHEMA]
})
export class HomeModule {}
```

///

### Routing setup

We will be setting up our `HomeModule` as a lazy-loaded module and as the default route. Open `app-routing.module.ts` and add the following code:

```typescript
// src/app/app-routing.module.ts

import { NgModule } from '@angular/core'
import { Routes } from '@angular/router'
import { NativeScriptRouterModule } from '@nativescript/angular'

const routes: Routes = [
  // Update this ðŸ‘‡
  { path: '', redirectTo: '/home', pathMatch: 'full' },

  // Add this ðŸ‘‡
  {
    path: 'home',
    loadChildren: () => import('./features/home/home.module').then(m => m.HomeModule)
  }
]

@NgModule({
  imports: [NativeScriptRouterModule.forRoot(routes)],
  exports: [NativeScriptRouterModule]
})
export class AppRoutingModule {}
```

:::tip Note
By default, `NgModules` are eagerly loaded, which means that they get loaded as soon as the application loads. Lazy-loaded modules on the other hand loads `NgModules` as needed. Lazy-loaded modules in NativeScript are handled the same way as a web Angular Application. You can read more about lazy loading modules [here](https://angular.io/guide/lazy-loading-ngmodules).
:::

### Home UI

Before we create the UI of our home page, let's create our `FlickModel` and `FlickService` first. This will allow us to use the data directly in our template.

`FlickModel` will contain the shape of each flick object. Create a `models` directory inside `core` and create a new file called `flick.model.ts`. Open the new `flick.model.ts` and add the following `interface`:

```typescript
// src/app/core/models/flick.model.ts

export interface FlickModel {
  id: number
  genre: string
  title: string
  image: string
  url: string
  description: string
  details: {
    title: string
    body: string
  }[]
}
```

We will the use the `FlickModel` in our `FlickService` to return our flick data. Create a `services` directory inside `core` and create a new file called `flick.service.ts`. Open the new `flick.service.ts` and add the following:

```typescript
// src/app/core/services/flick.service.ts

import { Injectable } from '@angular/core'
import { FlickModel } from '~/app/core/models'

@Injectable({
  providedIn: 'root'
})
export class FlickService {
  private flicks: FlickModel[] = [

          body: 'The Book of Mormon was conceived by Trey Parker, Matt Stone and Robert Lopez. Parker and Stone grew up in Colorado, and were familiar with The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and its members. They became friends at the University of Colorado Boulder and collaborated on a musical film, Cannibal! The Musical (1993), their first experience with movie musicals. In 1997, they created the TV series South Park for Comedy Central and in 1999, the musical film South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut. The two had first thought of a fictionalized Joseph Smith, religious leader and founder of the Latter Day Saint movement, while working on an aborted Fox series about historical characters. Their 1997 film, Orgazmo, and a 2003 episode of South Park, "All About Mormons", both gave comic treatment to Mormonism. Smith was also included as one of South Park\'s "Super Best Friends", a Justice League parody team of religious figures like Jesus and Buddha.'

Rudin advised the duo to see the musical Avenue Q on Broadway, finding the cast of marionettes in Team America similar to the puppets of Avenue Q. Parker and Stone went to see the production during that summer and the writer-composers of Avenue Q, Lopez and Jeff Marx, noticed them in the audience and introduced themselves. Lopez revealed that South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut was highly influential in the creation of Avenue Q. The quartet went for drinks afterwards, and soon found that each camp wanted to write something involving Joseph Smith. The four began working out details nearly immediately, with the idea to create a modern story formulated early on. For research purposes, the quartet took a road trip to Salt Lake City where they "interviewed a bunch of missionariesâ€”or ex-missionaries." They had to work around Parker and Stone\'s South Park schedule. In 2006, Parker and Stone flew to London where they spent three weeks with Lopez, who was working on the West End production of Avenue Q. There, the three wrote "four or five songs" and came up with the basic idea of the story. After an argument between Parker and Marx, who felt he was not getting enough creative control, Marx was separated from the project.[10] For the next few years, the remaining trio met frequently to develop what they initially called The Book of Mormon: The Musical of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. "There was a lot of hopping back and forth between L.A. and New York," Parker recalled.`

        The original stage production of Anastasia premiered at the Hartford Stage in Hartford, Connecticut on May 13, 2016 (previews). The show was directed by Darko Tresnjak and choreography by Peggy Hickey, with Christy Altomare and Derek Klena starring as Anya and Dmitry, respectively.
        Director Tresnjak explained: "We've kept, I think, six songs from the movie, but there are 16 new numbers. We've kept the best parts of the animated movie, but it really is a new musical." The musical also adds characters not in the film. Additionally, Act 1 is set in Russia and Act 2 in Paris, "which was everything modern Soviet Russia was not: free, expressive, creative, no barriers," according to McNally.
        The musical also omits the supernatural elements from the original film, including the character of Rasputin and his musical number "In the Dark of the Night", (although that songâ€™s melody is repurposed in the new number "Stay, I Pray You"), and introduces instead a new villain called Gleb, a general for the Bolsheviks who receives orders to kill Anya.`

:::tip Note
You can create barrel exports for your models and services to give you more flexibility in organizing your files and folders. To do this, create an `index.ts` in the your `services` and `models` directory and export `flick.service.ts` and `flick.model.ts` respectively. You can also add another `index.ts` in your `core` folder and export your `services` and `models` directory.
:::

Next, let's breaking down the layout and UI elements of the home page.

![Home page layout breakdown](./public/assets/images/tutorial/tutorial-example-app-master-breakdown.png)

The home page can be divided into two main parts, the actionbar with the title and the scrollable main content area with the cards (we will talk about the cards in the next section). Let's start with creating the action bar with the title. Open `home.component.html` and add the following code:

```html
<!-- src/app/features/home/home.component.html -->

<ActionBar title="NativeFlix"></ActionBar>
```

Since we have an array of flicks to display we can use NativeScript's [`ListView`](https://docs.nativescript.org/ui-and-styling.html#listview) component. `ListView` is a NativeScript UI component that efficiently renders items in a vertical or horizontal scrolling list. Let's first create a variable to our `HomeComponent` that we are going to use as our `ListView`'s data source. Open `home.component.ts` and add the following:

```typescript
// src/app/features/home/home.component.ts

import { Component } from '@angular/core'

// Add this ðŸ‘‡
import { FlickService } from '~/app/core'

@Component({
  moduleId: module.id,
  selector: 'ns-home',
  templateUrl: 'home.component.html'
})
export class HomeComponent {
  // Add this ðŸ‘‡
  flicks = this.flickService.getFlicks()

  constructor(
    // Add this ðŸ‘‡
    private flickService: FlickService
  ) {}
}
```

Next, open your `home.component.html` and add the `ListView` component:

```html
<!-- src/app/features/home/home.component.html -->

<ActionBar title="NativeFlix"></ActionBar>

<!-- Add this ðŸ‘‡ -->
<ListView height="100%" separatorColor="transparent" [items]="flicks">
  <ng-template let-item="item">
    <StackLayout>
      <label [text]="item.title"></label>
    </StackLayout>
  </ng-template>
</ListView>
```

`ListView` uses the `items` property as its data source. In the snippet above, we bind the `items` property to the `flicks` property which contains an array of flicks. If you run the app now, you should see a list of flick titles.

### Create flick cards

Before we dive into creating the card below, let's create some classes for our background and text colors that we will be using in the application. As this will be shared throughout the application, let's add this to the `app.scss`. Open `app.scss` and add the following:

```scss
// src/app.scss

// applied when device is in light mode
.ns-light {
  .bg-primary {
    background-color: #fdfdfd;
  }
  .bg-secondary {
    background-color: #ffffff;
  }
  .text-primary {
    color: #444;
  }
  .text-secondary {
    color: #777;
  }
}

// applied when device is in dark mode
.ns-dark {
  .bg-primary {
    background-color: #212121;
  }
  .bg-secondary {
    background-color: #383838;
  }
  .text-primary {
    color: #eee;
  }
  .text-secondary {
    color: #ccc;
  }
}
```

![Home page cards breakdown](./public/assets/images/tutorial/tutorial-example-app-master-card-breakdown.png)

As you can see in the image above, each card is made up of 3 components, the preview image, a title, and a description. We will be using a `GridLayout` as our container and use the `Image` and `Label` components for the preview image and texts. Open your `home.component.html` and add the following:

```html
<!-- src/app/features/home/home.component.html -->

<ActionBar title="NativeFlix"></ActionBar>

<ListView height="100%" separatorColor="transparent" [items]="flicks">
  <ng-template let-item="item">
    <!-- Add this ðŸ‘‡ -->
    <!-- The item template can only have a single root view container (e.g. GridLayout, StackLayout, etc.)-->
    <GridLayout
      height="280"
      rows="*, auto, auto"
      columns="*"
      class="bg-secondary"
      borderRadius="10"
      margin="5 10"
      padding="0"
    >
      <image row="0" margin="0" stretch="aspectFill" [src]="item.image"></image>
      <label
        row="1"
        margin="10 10 0 10"
        fontWeight="700"
        class="text-primary"
        fontSize="18"
        [text]="item.title"
      ></label>
      <label
        row="2"
        margin="0 10 10 10"
        class="text-secondary"
        fontSize="14"
        textWrap="true"
        [text]="item.description"
      ></label>
    </GridLayout>
  </ng-template>
</ListView>
```

### Checkpoint

If you've followed along this far, running the app on either platform should result in an app that resembles the one in this screenshot, with the list being scrollable vertically.
